# Design decisions — agent-memory-sdk

This is the single source of truth for decisions made on this project. Every
build step (see `PROMPTS.md`) must read this file before starting and append
a dated entry before finishing. Do not silently deviate from an existing
entry — if a later step needs to change one, add a new entry that
explicitly supersedes it and say why.

## 2026-07-29 — Foundational decisions (made before any code was written)

- **Language:** Python only.
- **Database:** IBM Db2 LUW.
- **Driver:** `ibm_db` (native) + `ibm_db_dbi` (DB-API 2.0 wrapper) as the
  primary connectivity layer. No SQLAlchemy dialect for v1.
- **Memory taxonomy** (synthesized from OpenAI Agents SDK memory docs,
  Oracle AI Agent Memory, and Microsoft Agent Framework/Cosmos DB memory),
  four types:
  1. **working memory** — raw current-session/thread turns, short-lived
  2. **episodic memory** — summarized past runs/threads/events
  3. **semantic memory** — extracted facts + aggregated entity/user profiles
  4. **procedural memory** — learned skills/instructions/how-to knowledge
- **Storage shape:** normalized per-type tables (one table per memory type
  above), not one polymorphic table. Reason: Db2's native vector index only
  activates when the vector column is `NOT NULL`, and each memory type has a
  differently-shaped/dimensioned embedding — a shared column fights that.
  This is closer to the Microsoft/Cosmos approach (separate collections)
  than Oracle's single unified core.
- **Vector search:** Db2 native `VECTOR` column type + `VECTOR_DISTANCE`
  (cosine, euclidean, dot, manhattan supported) + `CREATE VECTOR INDEX`
  (DiskANN-based ANN), with `FETCH EXACT` / `FETCH APPROX` / `FETCH` exposed
  to callers. Introduced in Db2 12.1.2+.
- **Processing model:** extraction/consolidation is pluggable and
  **synchronous by default** (developer-supplied callback run inline on
  `remember()`), with an explicit opt-in extension point to run it async
  later (e.g. via cron). Deliberately does NOT copy Microsoft's mandatory
  background-worker infra — this SDK must work as a plain installable
  library with zero required external services.
- **Framework integration:** framework-agnostic core first; LangChain,
  OpenAI Agents SDK (Session protocol), and MCP adapters are thin optional
  layers built on top, gated behind extras (`pip install
  agent-memory-sdk[langchain]`), not baked into the core.
- **Scoping/governance:** hierarchical scoping on every memory row —
  `tenant_id` (nullable, single-tenant ok) > `agent_id` > `user_id` >
  `thread_id`/`session_id`. Every read/write must be scoped; no cross-scope
  leakage by default. Every repository method requires at least `agent_id`.
- **Lifecycle:** soft-delete/tombstone via `deleted_at` (never hard DELETE
  by default), explicit `forget()` API, per-row `expires_at` TTL with a
  separate `purge_expired()` maintenance method (not automatic), and a
  `version` column for optimistic concurrency.

## 2026-07-30 — Bob MCP tool usage (superseded re: Jira, see next entry)

- **Decision:** Of Bob's available MCP connections, **Product Knowledge**
  (Milvus-backed semantic search over IBM docs — consulted for Db2
  VECTOR/index syntax in Step 2 and ibm_db driver behavior in Step 1, since
  these are IBM-specific and fast-moving) and **Web search** (Tavily —
  fallback for anything Product Knowledge doesn't cover) are used. Figma,
  Carbon, and Mural are left unused (design/UI tools, no fit for a headless
  library). Airtable, Amplitude, and Monday.com are left unused and
  unconfigured (require setup, and none fit this project's needs).
- **Reason:** Avoid setup/maintenance overhead on tools that don't serve
  this project, while using the two research-relevant tools to reduce the
  risk of the agent guessing at IBM/Db2-specific syntax from possibly-stale
  trained knowledge.
- **Made during:** Step 0 setup (before any build step ran).

## 2026-07-30 — Jira MCP dropped; tracking moved to a local HTML board

- **Decision:** Jira was originally planned for tracking (see prior entry),
  but Bob's Jira MCP connection isn't working. Tracking now uses
  `BOARD.html` — a single self-contained HTML file (Kanban-style: To
  Do/In Progress/Done) with the Epic and all 8 Stories embedded as JSON
  directly in the file. No server, no login, nothing to authorize. Agents
  update it by editing that embedded JSON and committing, the same way
  they update DECISIONS.md and ARCHITECTURE.md.
- **Reason:** The MCP connection failing is an external blocker, not a
  reason to stop tracking altogether — a local file has zero dependency on
  any external service being reachable, which also makes it more robust
  than Jira would have been for a build that may span disconnected
  sessions/tools.
- **Made during:** Step 0 setup (before any build step ran).
- **Supersedes:** the Jira-tracking half of the 2026-07-30 "Bob MCP tool
  usage" entry above. That entry's Product Knowledge/Web search decisions
  still stand.

## 2026-07-30 — Architecture/flow design lives in ARCHITECTURE.md, not a Bob MCP tool

- **Decision:** Current-state architecture and flow diagrams (component
  diagram, scoping model, schema ER diagram, remember()/recall() sequence
  diagrams) are captured in `ARCHITECTURE.md` at the repo root, using
  Mermaid — updated in place (overwritten) as the design evolves, not
  appended to like this file. None of Bob's MCP-connected tools were used
  for this, on evaluation.
- **Reason:** Mural's MCP access is read-only (can't write diagrams there).
  Product Knowledge is a read-only search index over IBM's own docs, not a
  place to store ours. Jira is a tracker — fine for linking to a design
  doc, bad as the doc itself (no diagramming, no single current-state
  view, gets unwieldy). Figma/Carbon are UI-design tools, wrong domain for
  a headless library. Airtable/Amplitude/Monday.com don't fit this project
  (see the 2026-07-30 MCP tool usage entry above). A versioned markdown
  file with Mermaid diagrams has no external auth dependency, is diffable,
  and renders natively in GitHub and most markdown viewers.
- **Made during:** Step 0 setup (before any build step ran).
- **How to apply:** Every build step that changes the design (schema,
  component boundaries, flows) must update the relevant section of
  `ARCHITECTURE.md`, not just append a DECISIONS.md entry. DECISIONS.md
  answers "why"; ARCHITECTURE.md answers "what, right now."

## Open / not yet decided (fill in as steps happen)

- Embedding dimension(s) per memory type — depends on embedding model
  chosen by the SDK user; document how the schema parameterizes this.
- Build backend for `pyproject.toml` (hatchling vs setuptools) — decide in
  Step 1, record the choice + reason here.
- Exact distance metric per table (cosine vs euclidean vs dot) — decide in
  Step 2, record per-table choice + reason here.
- Whether `content`/`metadata` use CLOB vs VARCHAR vs Db2 JSON type —
  decide in Step 2.
