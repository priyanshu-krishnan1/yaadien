## 2025-07-31 — CI pipeline: lint, type-check, and unit tests (PH-1)

**Workflow file:** `.github/workflows/ci.yml`

**Triggers:** `push` to `main`; all `pull_request` events.

**Python version matrix:** `3.10`, `3.11`, `3.12`
Matches `requires-python = ">=3.10"` in `pyproject.toml` and the three
`Programming Language :: Python :: 3.1x` classifiers declared there.
`fail-fast: false` so a failure on one version does not cancel the others.

**Steps each matrix entry runs:**

| Step | Command |
|---|---|
| Install | `pip install -e ".[dev]"` |
| Lint | `ruff check .` |
| Type-check | `mypy src` |
| Unit tests | `pytest` |

**Install:** Editable install with the `[dev]` extra only
(`pytest>=8.0`, `pytest-cov>=5.0`, `ruff>=0.4`, `mypy>=1.10`,
`python-dotenv>=1.0`). The `[langchain]`, `[openai-agents]`, and `[mcp]`
extras are intentionally excluded — adapter-specific dependency-version
drift is out of scope for this job.

**Lint:** `ruff check .` validates all source files against the rule set
declared in `[tool.ruff.lint]` (`E`, `F`, `I`, `UP`, `B`, `SIM`, ignoring
`E501`).

**Type-check:** `mypy src` runs with the `[tool.mypy]` config in
`pyproject.toml` (`strict = true`, `ignore_missing_imports = true` for
`ibm_db` which ships no stubs).

**Unit tests:** Plain `pytest` with no extra exclusion flags. The
`tests/integration/` suite self-skips when `DB2_DATABASE` is unset via the
`pytest_collection_modifyitems` hook in
`tests/integration/conftest.py` — no `-k` or `--ignore` flag is needed.

**Pip cache:** `actions/cache@v4` keyed on
`pip-<python-version>-<sha256 of pyproject.toml>` with a version-scoped
restore key. Invalidates automatically whenever `pyproject.toml` changes
(i.e. whenever a dependency version pin is bumped).

**Status badge:** Added to `README.md` — links to the Actions run list for
the `ci.yml` workflow.

**Follow-up items already on the board (not built here):**
- PH-2: integration job with a live Db2 service container
- PH-3: coverage reporting via `pytest-cov` + Codecov badge + threshold gate
- PH-4: `pip-audit` + `bandit` security scanning
- PH-5: packaging build verification (`python -m build` + `twine check`)
